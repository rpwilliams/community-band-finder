# Community Band and Orchestra Finder

In an effort to continue playing my trombone after college, I searched Google for a 'community band finder'. To my suprise, there was no such thing in existence, which lead to my motivation for this project.

This repository contains two parts: 
- A Python web scraper, found in /resources/web-scraper/, that obtains/updates community band data, with permission from the owners of http://www.community-music.info
- An express.js application that gets all community bands and orchestras within a 75 mile radius of a given location via the [Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)
